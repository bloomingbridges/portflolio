Florian is a young Creative Technologist from the heart of Europe and a firm believer in world betterment by the means of quality digital entertainment and tangible experiences. His work touches many disciplines: from New Media Art, over Interaction / UI design to Game Development.

On a related note, he is also a proud member of [Appsterdam][1] and founder of the [hanebouken game collective][2]. In his former life, he's probably been a penguin.
