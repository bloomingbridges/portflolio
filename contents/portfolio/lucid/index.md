An ambitious research project exploring the practicality of videogames, which can be played in your sleep, conducted by _Ben Ashman_, _Sam Billingham_, _Luke Wotton_ and yours truly. __Lucid__ is experienced in a full-dome environment using custom gear for head-tracking and player input using phone accelerometer sensors and a fair amount of Velcro&reg;. 

__Lucid__'s concept has undergone many iterations. Originally, we just wanted to build upon [Zen Trials](/portfolio/zen_trials/index.html), add more challenges and adjust it for the dome environment.

Inspired by leftover ideas from the previous project and a talk by visiting speaker Luke Jerram's project [Dream Concert](http://www.lukejerram.com/projects/dream_concert), we got really excited picturing 25 people going to sleep in the _IVT_, somehow collectively feeding into a visualisation, which no single one of them would ever be able to witness.

<!-- So there was some research to be done on how we could mass-produce biofeedback measuring devices on a budget: Perhaps an Arduino with an SD-card shield? Bluetooth heart-rate wristbands? Technologically-enhanced sleeping bags? -->

<!-- On the other hand, we didn't want to diverge too far from the game aspect of things and around the same time, I developed an urge to experiment with algorithmically generated environments in Unity.. well you can't please everyone. -->

In the end we focused on the dome experience, put on a little show. We dressed everything up as an experiment, organised by a mysterious organisation hunting for new recruits, promising to teach them the ability to _dream lucidly_ if they would stop by the dome and pass a series of tests. 

In preparation for the trials one would have to sleep with a mobile phone running the complimentary _lucid app_. Disguised as an alarm clock app (written in CoffeeScript, Cordova), the app would figure out the user's sleep cycle and play back audio hints required to master the trials when the participant is the most conscious.

There were a total of three trials in __Lucid__. We even had a volunteer who actually used the app on the day of the presentation: _Saul Hardman_ was the lucky guy, getting to put on our unwieldy dome input device and work through the puzzles.

He did not succeed. That's the thing with experiments, but sometimes you just need to go for it. Feel free to read the full story on the [project blog](http://sambillingham.github.io/lucid/), study the [source code](https://github.com/Sambillingham/lucid) and download the complimentary
