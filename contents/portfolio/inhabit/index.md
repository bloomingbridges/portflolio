With __INHABIT__, we wanted to create a modular home automation system geared towards people sharing a space together rather than families. The initial concept comprised of a digital corkboard, showing the whereabouts of all household members (depending on their privacy settings) amongst some live data about the house / flat in general.

A monitor would hang on a wall somehwere - potentially the common room - whilst being accessible over the local network as well via a web interface. The latter would also be used to, for instance, send hot drink requests to housemates or send notifications to particular users if they were making too much noise.

The biggest innovation of __INHABIT__ however, was its intelligent house automation system, based on user habits. Each member of the household would each set a preference for indoor temperature. This decision will be taken into consideration the next time the user returns home, together with factors like outdoor temperature, costs, time of day etc.

Our prototype system was based on _RFID_ keychains (, which would potentially  double as keys themselves). Future additions would have included tracking people via GPS and software for collaborative shopping lists, leaving notes, sensing who's asleep among many others.

We're pleased to report that __INHABIT__ won the __IBM Smarter Planet Prize 2012__. Read the [full blog post](http://bloomingbridges.github.io/Sammelsurium/inhabit/).
