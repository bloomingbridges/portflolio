When thinking back about my time at [Plymouth University](http://plymouth.ac.uk), the one project that stands out as the most fulfilling, the most genuinely practical and most critically acclaimed is not the one I put the most lines of code or tears in, but the final group effort of [Saul Hardman](http://saulhardman.com), [James King](http://lostwith.me), [Ben Ashman](http://benashman.me) and myself for the __DAT302 Everyware__ module: __Flask__.

Quoting directly from the [project blog](http://sorakasumi.github.io/flask/):

> __Flask__ is a bottle that collects data. It condenses streams of 1s and 0s and represents the quantity stored using light. It plays on the inherent affordances of its form to map real world actions to digital functions â€“ its cork can be removed and replaced to start and stop the collection of data and its contents can be poured, at varying rates, onto a surface.

And here is the [video demonstration](http://vimeo.com/66462979):

## The Journey

## Exhibition and Shortcomings

Degree show 2013, Microsoft Surface table version (IE10), wifi issues, bluetooth?

## The End of an Era

In many ways do I consider __Flask__ to be the pinnacle of my academic career: We rushed head first into the unknown, disregarding the brief for the most part, only lead by our intuition and longing to create. This had been the last opportunity to prove to ourselves that we could build anything we wanted. Our goal? We simply wanted to make something that would be _worthy to appear on [creativeapplications](http://creativeapplications.net)_. 

Four guys coding together in a tiny living room, consuming liter upon liter of black tea (and squash for James), equipped with laptops and their individual talents, not really knowing what exactly it was they were building. In a way, __Flask__ not only captures the spirit of what university life should have been like all along, it stands as the manifestation of our friendship. In a bottle. 2013. What a year.
