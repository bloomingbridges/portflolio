This title is an abandoned game prototype, which I created on a whim in _Unity_ after my dream job application was declined. It was supposed to tell the story of the application process: how I was unhappy doing unchallenging, repetitive tasks for large businesses and how they could steer me out of this funk and into a brighter future.
