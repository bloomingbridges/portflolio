Deep inside every young adult who's been exposed to a fair share of interactive entertainment at an early stage in his or her life, there lies this burning desire to create their own videogames. I've certainly been there and not too long ago I made a decision to feed that desire and start working towards making that dream a reality.

The name for my creative outlet would be __hanebouken__, a portmanteau of the German word "haneb√ºchen" (colloquial for _fairly hard to believe / questionable_, literally a [type of tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpinus_betulus)) and _hadouken_, which stands symbolic for a youth wasted trying to beat my friends at _Street Fighter II_.

The deal was such, that I would seek out talented people to collaborate with on small projects, little programming challenges in a beautiful wrapper for the sake of learning and exploration. 

What sounds great on paper does not always work out in real life though:
Interested folks are either too busy doing whatever brings them money, would rather try making it on their own or won't lift a finger unless we'd be planning to _make money_..

It's a vicious dilemma. One part of me is completely fixated on nurturing my game development expertise, whilst the designer half of me has high expectations as to what the outcome will look like. Certainly, there are people out there who are doing great on their own, but I'm in need of a Pinky for my Brain, a Laurel for my Hardy, the feta cheese for my watermelon salad.

So I guess I will continue to check out every new game engine, technology and game that the internet throws at me, continue waiting for the ONE, continue coding up prototypes and writing whingey blog post on [hanebouken.com](http://www.hanebouken.com) about my misfortunes, whilst gradually building up an expertise, that will allow me to - one day - make the unbelievable, achievable.
