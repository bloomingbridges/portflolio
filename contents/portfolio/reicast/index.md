Living with the single author of a _Dreamcast_ emulator fork for the _Android_ platform has a few benefits, one being that you get to design a last-minute logo on release day.

The design was based on a sketch a contributor from Argentina made, which showed the original blue swirl fragmented and made up of rectangles instead. Naturally, the first thing I did was to fire up Processing and see whether I could reproduce that idea in a procedural way.

A quick video demo can be seen [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vk4x4hayram05rs/reicast_logo.mov), or check the slightly less impressive _Processing.js_ implementation on the [reicast website](http://reicast.com). In other news, there is a guy on the internet [running _reicast_ on his watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZmdEl9yAvI&feature=share)..
