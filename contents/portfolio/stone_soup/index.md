Whilst the old folk tale of the [stone soup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Soup) is already fascinating by itself, the story I want to tell is a modern adaption, about a Dutchman named _Klaas Speller_ and the soup he is currently simmering in downtown Athens. Greece.

If you haven't been to Greece lately (or ever), you are in for an interesting ride. Pushing through the general χάος (chaos) in the streets covered in artful graffiti and the sweet smell of _boiled_ coffee (Greek style!), after  dodging dog foulings, sunlight, lottery ticket vendors and the occasional bullet or molotov cocktail, you will eventually make it to the fifth floor of an old office building on Charilaou Trikoupi.

On said floor you will - most likely - encounter the dynamic duo [Klaas](http://twitter.com/spllr) and [Olga](http://twitter.com/olmageddon), the digital diplomats of _Appsterdam Greece_. They were not only kind enough to invite me over to live, work and play with them in Athens for a little more than two months, they also involved me in shaping what is - for the lack of a better name - now to be known as __Stone Soup__. The least I could do to return the gesture was to give their enterprise a face.

The promise of __Stone Soup__ is to provide people with a place to acquire and share skills or simply an actual project to work on. In _Appsterdam_ fashion they organise talks and workshops, not only for the technologically-minded but for anyone who wants to learn.

Their logo should reflect all that: a diverse mix of people and skills, everybody contributing and thus adding flavour to and tweaking the soup, a strong community , a vortex of ideas raging around the confines of an office floor. 
Additionally, the branding should be easy to modify for different types of events and have a slight _Dutch_ touch to it (read: diagonal grid).
